            <h3 class="text-animation">I'm a <span></span></h3>
            <p>Passionate and determined learner with a strong interest in technology, coding, and personal development.
                I enjoy solving complex problems, exploring cybersecurity, and building creative digital projects. I
                believe in continuous growth and discipline, which is why I challenge myself daily through structured
                routines and learning systems like "Odyssey Black." Alongside programming, I also prepare for academic
                goals such as the SAT and IELTS. My vision is to study abroad, gain global experience, and use my skills
                to protect and uplift others. Focused, resilient, and driven — I strive to turn setbacks into strength.
            </p>

                    <h3>High School</h3>
                    <p>The year I truly woke up. I began to question everything: who I was, what I wanted, and how far I
                        was willing to go. I started learning programming, prepared for IELTS, and built a stronger
                        routine. Though I made mistakes, this year planted the seeds of resilience and self-awareness.
                        It was the end of comfort and the beginning of purpose.</p>

                    <h3>Lyceum </h3>
                    <p>This was the year of focused effort. I built habits, followed personal systems like Odyssey
                        Black, and committed fully to goals like IELTS and SAT mastery. I learned to stay disciplined,
                        even without motivation. I took on more responsibility, deepened my coding skills, and sharpened
                        my mental edge. 2024 was not easy — and that’s why it changed me.</p>

                    <p>This is the year everything comes together. I apply what I’ve built — confidence, skills, and
                        mindset — into action. I aim for scholarships, national universities, and real-world
                        projects. 2025 isn’t just a goalpost — it’s a mission to prove to myself that all the late
                        nights, silent work, and sacrifices were worth it.</p>
